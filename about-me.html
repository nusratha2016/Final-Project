    <p>
      &emsp; Hey! I'm <strong>Nusrath</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others and also on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn,</strong> <strong>College, </strong> <strong>Github</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. Also same time I get to practice my <strong> Photography</strong> to improve my skills.
