      <p>
        &emsp; When Spring comes! The cherry trees are starting to bloom again around the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. In the Spring, life moves from interior to exterior space and temperatures move from cold to mellow. The color green fills the world after the grey and white colors of winter. Cherry blossoms a time of renewal, their life is very short. After their beauty peaks around two weeks, the blossoms start to fall. I have lovely memories from Brooklyn Botanic Garden when I was in college, in American schools begin in the fall, having a little picnic with my best friends, each of us packed a special lunch box, full of our favorite foods. we fall in love with this garden even though there are so many places in New York but we always end up with this garden. Cherry Blossoms trees are very famous throughout the world. We're very lucky to have those cherry trees around in Brooklyn, New York.

      <p>
        &emsp;  When Fall colors appear, other color changes are taking place. At the point where the stem of the leaf is connected to the tree, a extraordinary layer of cells creates and slowly separates the tissues that back the leaf. At the same time, the tree seals the cut, so that when the leaf is at last blown off by the wind or falls from its possess weight, it takes off behind a leaf scar.

      <p>
        &emsp; The tree often symbolize family and home. Many people often make their homes in the branches of trees; not only people also birds often build their nests in the high branches to stay away from predators. Those branches also sybmolize family, because of the way that people draw out family trees. Family trees branch off into different directions, just like the physical trees. The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge are both in Paradise.

      <p>
        &emsp; Foods make everything better. You have more chances than you realize to connect with your family at the table. But we all know that not everyone get chances to eat with their family. It is up to us make more time if we want to connect with our family in the table. One thing I learned in my life is that happiness is not the something you can get anytime or niether money can buy happiness. The real happiness comes when we connect with our family, friends. Also when we share our foods with our family, friends or colleague.

      <p>
        &emsp; The bridge is inherently typical of communication and union, whether it be between this side of the world or the other side of the world. It may be the entry to reality, or simply a symbol for travel and crossing. In dreams, a bridge symbolizes the section from one state to another, higher one, like a rising; it is the conclusion of one cycle and the starting of another. In many societies it is the connect between what can be seen and what is past recognition, or at slightest a change or want for change. Can be a test to see who is courageous (who will cross).

      <p>
        &emsp; The wisteria and the bloom are both widespread symbols of youthful life. Blooms are related with the SUN since the arrangement of its petals is reminiscent of the shape of a STAR; they may be guiltless agents of spring, or they may assign desire and the domain of the suggestive. The flower is regularly a representative of excellence. The color of the blossom regularly contains a extraordinary bargain to do with the symbolism it carries red is love and passion, white is innocence and chastity.

      <p>
        &emsp; The summer is the time of romance and unbounded potential. The color of summer is yellow and temperatures move from gentle to warm. In case Spring is the time of birth, at that point summer is the time of youth where one moves through the world with heavenly ease and consolation.
