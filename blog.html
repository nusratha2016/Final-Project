        &emsp; Spring has arrived! The cherry trees are starting to bloom again around the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. In U.S.A. and Japan, cherry blossoms are called sakura, a special flower for the people and the country. Cherry blossoms a time of renewal, their life is very short. After their beauty peaks around two weeks, the blossoms start to fall. I have lovely memories from Brooklyn Botanic Garden when I was teenager, in American schools begin in the fall, having a little picnic with my best friends, each of us packed a special lunch box, full of our favorite foods. Cherry Blossoms trees are very famous throughout the world. We're very lucky to have those cherry trees around in Brooklyn, New York.
